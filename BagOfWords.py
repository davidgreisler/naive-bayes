    A bag of words, maps words to occurrence count in a document.
    
    A bag of words contains words extracted from a text. It stores words and how often they occurred
    in the text, but has no knowledge about the order of words/original text.
    
    When the constructor is called with a text as argument, it'll count the words in it and put them
    in the bag. Add more words with add_word(). It is also possible to merge bags using merge().
    
    Use number_of_words to get the total amount of words in the bag, number_of_distinct_words on the
    other hand, gives you only the amount of distinct words in the bag. Use count_word() to find out
    how often a specific word occurs in the bag. The method words() returns a dictionary mapping 
    words to occurrence count.
